# Project: College Essay Coach

## 1. High-Level Vision

A web application that provides a personalized, conversational experience to help high school students brainstorm, structure, and refine their college application essays. The core of the app is an AI-powered conversational agent that acts as an expert college essay counselor.

## 2. Target Audience

- High school students applying to colleges.
- Students who may not have access to expensive college counselors.
- Students who are unsure where to start with their essays and need guidance.

## 3. The AI Agent's Persona

The AI agent should embody the following characteristics:

- **Expert & Experienced:** Gives advice that reflects deep knowledge of what makes a successful college essay. Its tone should be similar to an elite, private college counselor.
- **Encouraging & Supportive:** Creates a safe and positive space for students to be vulnerable and share their stories. It should be patient and avoid being critical or robotic.
- **Inquisitive & Insightful:** Asks thoughtful, open-ended questions that prompt deep reflection. It should be good at "reading between the lines" to help students find the core of their stories.
- **Structured & Goal-Oriented:** Guides the conversation purposefully from brainstorming to a concrete outline, without letting it drift aimlessly.
- **Personalized:** Tailors its questions and advice based on the student's individual responses and background.

## 4. Core Features (Initial MVP)

- **Conversational Interview:** An interactive chat interface where the AI agent asks probing questions to help students uncover compelling personal stories and themes for their essays.
- **Essay Topic Brainstorming:** Based on the interview, the agent suggests potential essay topics and angles.
- **Outline Generation:** The agent helps the student structure their chosen topic into a coherent essay outline.

## 5. Future Features (Out of Scope for MVP)

- **Essay Feedback & Refinement:** Providing constructive feedback on full essay drafts.
- **Multiple Essay Types:** Support for supplemental essays, not just the main personal statement.
- **User Accounts & Progress Saving.**

## 6. Project Goals & Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal:** Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can successfully guide a student from having no ideas to having a structured essay outline they feel confident about.
- **Success Metric:** A user completes the entire brainstorming and outlining process and gives positive feedback on the generated outline.
